    date: "14th August 2026",
    time: "1:30 PM",
    venue: "Civil Auditorium, University of Moratuwa",
    abstract: "The rapid electrification of transport, buildings, and industry, together with increasing distributed energy resource (DER) penetration, is transforming electric distribution networks. Traditional static network limits are inadequate for managing the uncertainty and phase imbalance introduced by rooftop PV, battery storage, electric vehicles, and flexible loads, particularly in low-voltage feeders with predominantly single-phase connections. Dynamic Operating Envelopes (DOEs) offer a promising framework for adaptive, uncertainty-aware capacity allocation, but existing methods largely overlook unbalanced three-phase effects and equitable allocation across customers. This talk presents a robust DOE framework for unbalanced three-phase LV networks, computing uncertainty-aware envelopes using sensitivity-based robust optimisation under box uncertainty and integrating these into a chance-constrained scheduling framework for electric vehicle charging that accounts for stochastic departure times and battery degradation. Fairness in envelope allocation across customers is also addressed. The talk concludes by discussing open challenges in DOE deployment, including network modelling assumptions and computational scalability.",
